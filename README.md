### MovieDB

### Description

**MovieDB** is a project developed to explore the **TheMovieDB** API and configure communication between the front-end and back-end in a single project.

This project was built using **Typescript**, **React**, and **NextJS** for the front-end, and **Typescript**, **ExpressJS**, and **Prisma ORM** for the back-end, with a relational database for storing user and favorite movie information.
